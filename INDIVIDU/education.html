<h1 style="color:green; font-size:300%">PRE -SCHOOL AND PRIMARY SCHOOL </h1>
<p style="background-color:turquoise; font-size:200%">In 2003 my mother enrolled me to pre -school at Sekolah Kebangsaan Machang 2. This school is not far from my house. Every morning my mom would send me to school on a motorcycle. I studied at that school until I was 12 years old. I have many acquaintances at the school.
2009 was my last year at that school. I got 3A 2B in UPSR at the time.

<h2 style="color:yellow; font-size:300%">SECONDARY SCHOOL</h2>
<p style="background-color:blueviolet; font-size:200%"> I have furthered my studies at Machang City National High School. The school is also not far from home, I go to school every day on foot. In this school I learned a lot about new things and also gained a variety of new knowledge as well as what is the meaning of friendship. During the time I spent studying in this high school, I gained various experiences from kind and responsible teachers. I finished my studies at this secondary school in 2014 with SPM results that can be said to be neither bad nor very good. Yet I am thankful that God has always helped me and provided ample sustenance to taste new experiences that others may not have been able to go through.

<h3 style="color:deeppink; font-size:300%">MARA UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY (UiTM)</h3>
<p style="background-color:blanchedalmond; font-size:200%"> In 2017, I was given the sustenance to further my studies to the Diploma level at UiTM Kelantan. At that time I was 21 years old. I have been taking khursus in Information Management for over 3 years and soon I will be finishing my studies all this time. And if given another chance, I would like to continue my studies to the degree level because for me, gaining knowledge is not a loss and does not know age.
